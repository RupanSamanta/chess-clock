### 🔧 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

No build tools are required for the basic app. To run a local development server, you can use any static server or a VS Code extension like Live Server.

#### Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/chess-clock.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd chess-clock
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.** You can double-click the file or use a development server. For example, using Python's simple server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### ⚙️ Usage

* **Start**: Begins the initial player's clock.
* **Switch/Move**: Tap the active clock to pause your time and start your opponent's time.
* **Pause**: Stops both clocks.
* **Reset**: Resets both timers to the selected preset.
* **Settings**: Choose your desired base time and increment/delay before starting the match.

### 🧩 Configuration (Ideas)

This project is designed to be easily extendable. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Space` to switch, `P` to pause).
* Add persistent settings using `localStorage` to remember the last used preset.
* Implement themes (dark, light) and accessibility options (larger fonts).
